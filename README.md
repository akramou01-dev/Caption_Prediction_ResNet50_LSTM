# Caption_Prediction_ResNet50_LSTM

This is a notebook when we implement a model that predict captions based on images using the Residual Networks and LSTMs architecture.
We used a dataset for training when each image contains the captions that holds in text, then we done some NLP on texts and concatening 2 models , one for the images and the other for the text prediction.
